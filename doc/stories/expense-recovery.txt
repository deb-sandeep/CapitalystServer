Expense Recovery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some debit transactions are later either fully or partially recovered by one
or more credit transactions. For example - medical expense reimbursement,
cashback, agent commission payback, etc.

Such reversals have an effect on budget tracking and needs to be accounted for.

Functional Approach
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Budget Tracker
    - Each debit transaction needs to be checked for any credit recoveries
    - If found, the debit amount needs to be suitably adjusted before
      computing budget burn
      
- Ledger
      
    - Every credit entry should have an action associated with it to 
      associate it with debit entries.
      
    - Clicking on the action should show a dialog containing
        - Existing debit associations
            - Each association should have a recovery amount
        - Paged list of debit transactions from which one or more transactions
          can be selected
        - Validation
            - Sum of all recover amounts should equal to or less than the
              credit amount
            - No recovery amount can be negative
            - No recovery amount can be empty
            
    - Every debit entry whose cost has been fully or partially recovered should
      have an icon associated with it
      
        - Clicking the icon should show a read only dialog of all credit
          transactions which have contributed to expense recovery

Design approach
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Database table - expense_recovery_association

    debit_txn_id  - ref integrity to ledger id
    credit_txn_id - ref integrity to ledger id
    recovery_amt  - float
    note          - varchar(64)
    
- JPA mapping and repository (ledger package)

    - ExpenseRecovery (expense_recovery_association)
    - ExpenseRecoveryRepo 

- API
    - ExpenseRecoveryAPI ( /ExpenseRecovery )
        - POST /Save
            - Takes an array of ExpenseRecovery objects
            - Deletes and re-applies mapping
        - GET /{ledgerEntryId}
            - Can take a credit or debit id
            - Returns a list of ExpenseRecovery instances
        - DELETE /{expenseRecoveryId}
            - Deletes the association
    - Ledger API
        - Marker for debit entries which have recovery associated with them
            
- Ledger controller and UI

    - UI trigger for invoking recovery edit dialog
    - UI trigger for invoking view credit transactions for recovery
    - Associated controller changes to show, hide, cancel and save dialog
    
- CreditRecoveryEditDialog

- CreditRecoveryViewDialog

- Budget Tracker
    - API
    - UI should not have any changes
